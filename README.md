# Capture Network Traffic Using Wireshark

## Objective
The objective of this task is to capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark and understand how data packets flow across a network, with a focus on HTTP traffic analysis.

---

## Tool Used
- Wireshark

---

## System Requirements
- Windows / Linux operating system
- Active internet connection
- Wireshark installed with packet capture permissions enabled

---

## Steps Performed

### Step 1: Install Wireshark
Wireshark was installed from the official website. During installation, the packet capture driver (Npcap) was also installed to enable network traffic capture.

---

### Step 2: Launch Wireshark and Select Network Interface
Wireshark was launched and the active network interface (Wi-Fi/Ethernet) was selected based on network activity. The interface with visible traffic graphs was chosen for packet capture.

---

### Step 3: Capture Network Traffic
Live packet capture was started on the selected interface. Wireshark captured real-time network packets including TCP, DNS, HTTP, and other protocols generated by the system.

---

### Step 4: Generate HTTP Traffic
A web browser was used to visit an HTTP website to generate HTTP traffic for analysis.

---

### Step 5: Apply HTTP Filter
The display filter `http` was applied to view only HTTP packets. This helped isolate unencrypted web traffic.

---

### Step 6: Analyze Packets
HTTP packets were analyzed to observe:
- Request methods (GET/POST)
- Hostnames
- URLs
- Packet source and destination

This demonstrated how HTTP traffic is transmitted in plaintext.

### Step 7: Save Capture File
The captured traffic was saved as:
